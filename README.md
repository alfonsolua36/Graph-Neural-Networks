### Graph Nueral Networks

## Introduction

Here you will find articles and slides that I have compiled for Graph Neural Networks. This was utilized for resaerch during my undergraduate time at UCLA. 

## Graph

A graph in computer science is a way to structure data. It consists of nodes to represent entities, and edges that represent the relationship between these entities. Further, each node may also have a set of features that may describe that node. As for edges, they can either be undirected [two-way] or directed [one-way]. So to put this into picture graphs could be described as

## Neural Networks

Neural Networks are able to learn a variety of desired outputs from several kind of inpute which can come in the form of numbers, stock prices, words, images, etc. This type of neural network works best for data that is structures, However, one downside is that neural networks struggle with graphs that don't have a fixed structure like the one above. This is where we stepped in and did research on things of this nature. 

## Convulational Neural Networks

Common Convulational Neural Network is a method used to analyze different inputs. For instance, it could extract information on an image by looking at each indiviudal pixel and the region around it and aggregating the information. The next layer will then extracts information about that region and the process continues until the network is able to reason over different parts of the whole image.
